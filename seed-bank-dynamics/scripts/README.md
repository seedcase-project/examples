# Data set on Dung Beetle activity in rainforests

These data sets were first copied from
[ZENODO](https://zenodo.org/records/4965431)
in december 2024. They are looking at how the activity of Dung Beetles
affect the dynamics of a rainforest seed bank and on seedling establishment. It is
licensed in the public domain and can be used for any purpose. If you
have ended up here in search of the actual data you should go to the
original source.

The data sets are from **experiment 3** in the form of two csv files and contains 5 columns each. It is
interesting to us because experiment 3 contains a link field with experiment 2, which means
that we could use it in future when we want to test linking data sets together.
