# Data set on free-living birds in Sweden

This data set was first copied from
[ZENODO](https://zenodo.org/records/4965431)
in december 2024. The data set is looking at how the activity of Dung Beetles
affect the dynamics of a rainforest seed bank and on seedling establishment. It is
licensed in the public domain and can be used for any purpose. If you
have ended up here in search of the actual data set you should go to the
original source.

The data set is from experiment 3 in the form of a csv file and contains 5 columns. It is
interesting to us because experiment 3 contains a link field with experiment 2, which means
that we could use it in future when we want to test linking data sets together.
