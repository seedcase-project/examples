# Data set on

This data set was copied from this [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7055715) record. The data
set is looking various effects of maternal obesity in rhesus monkeys. If you have ended up here in search of the actual data set you should go to the original source.

The data set is in the form of 14 csv and 3 xlsx files and mostly contains data on metabolomics, but also behaviour and cognition. It is interesting to us as a test case for handling more than one or two resources for a single data package because there are so many files, and they are in different formats.
