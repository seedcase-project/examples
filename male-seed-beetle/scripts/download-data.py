"""Downloads a data file from a given URL.

This is the most basic of the download data scripts. It requires that the url for 
the data is provided as an argument, and it assumes that a data-raw folder 
has been created containing a .gitignore file.

Args:
    url: the url for the data file given as an argument.

Returns:
    No return as such, but a file is fetched and saved to the relevant folder in the repo.

Raises:
    No error messages for now, but will need one if it can't find the file.
