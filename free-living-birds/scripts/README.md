# Data set on free-living birds in Sweden

This data set was first copied from
[DRYAD](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.05qfttf7g)
in november 2024. The data set is looking at whether or not an Immune
challenge reduces the daily activity period in free-living birds. It is
licensed in the public domain and can be used for any purpose. If you
have ended up here in search of the actual data set you should go to the
original source.

The data set is in the form of a csv file and contains 29 columns. It is
interesting to us because it not only contains string based data, but
also numerical and date related data, which makes it a good test case
for the Seedcase software.
