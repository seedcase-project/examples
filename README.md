# Use cases for Seedcase

This repository will contain examples with real data using the Seedcase
software, in order to show how it can be used in practice.

In the first instance the examples will be using the core scripts from
Seedcase Sprout to take in, organise, and store data from csv files. The
intention is to expand these with the other Seedcase scripts as they are
developed.
